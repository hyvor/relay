## Architecture

- **PHP + Symfony** for the API backend.
- **Go** for email workers, webhook handlers, DNS server, and the incoming SMTP server.
- **SvelteKit** and [**Hyvor Design System**](https://github.com/hyvor/design) for the frontend.
- **PGSQL** is used for the database as well as for the queue.
